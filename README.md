Imperative version was working before I started trying to implement a second main to incorporate the functional, kept recieving a really frustrating error pertaining to the common object not being found.

This was the line the user could input  to see the input printed before everything started breaking, I posted a picture on Slack of it working earlier.

##To run imperative


## To run functional

sbt "runMain src.main.scala.functional.Main" <   inputData/input.txt

I'm going to continue working on this as a learning tool, I think I'm really close.
